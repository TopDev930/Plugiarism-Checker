           Tertiary institutions like universities and colleges need an efficient plagiarism checking system put in place, so as to ensure that journals, dissertations, thesis, term papers and research articles submitted by students, lecturers and researchers are qualitative and original. This is to forestall any issues that might arise as a consequence of infringing copyright and authorship laws, and also to ascertain the integrity of a submitted document and prevent theft of intellectual property. Students that are aware that their universities make use of a plagiarism checker to review their works often personally check their works for plagiarism before submitting, which may not be advisable, especially using free plagiarism checkers online. This is because some websites lure people by claiming to offer free plagiarism checks, but end up selling students’ assignments to other students. In situations like this, the student’s assignment will show up as stolen or plagiarized after submission and review. According to Sidney Kawimbe, students now prefer outsourcing their coursework and assignments, and it is the current academic system and its members that lose in this case, rather than the students or the hired writers. He has this to say: “the ideals that they hold regarding ethics, integrity and academic honors are thrown out the window” (Kawimbe, 2017).

           For a university plagiarism checking tool to be effective and productive, it must be as user-friendly as possible without compromising throughput and speed. Some of the important features of a working university plagiarism checking tool include:
           <br/>
           <ol>
             <li>Add/Remove Users: This feature allows new users to register and be added to the plagiarism checking tool. Old users can log in and use the system while new users can create new account profiles. While this is not an important feature for a personal account on a plagiarism checking system, the system administrator uses this functionality to manage the registration of the end users and authentication of account details, bearing in mind that privileges differ between students' and teachers' accounts on the system.
             </li>
             <li>Assign Submissions: When students submit their documents for plagiarism check on the system, these submissions are assigned to be reviewed by the teachers by a predefined algorithm. This means that the submitted documents are usually assigned to each teacher at the discretion of the system administrator of the university or faculty. For example, a total of 1000 submitted documents to be reviewed for plagiarism might be distributed evenly amongst the 10 registered teachers on the university's plagiarism checking system or depending on another basis.</li>
             <li>Status of Submission: This feature is exclusive to the teacher's account as it allows the teacher to see what documents have been assigned to him/her to review, and displays a pop-up message if there are new files assigned for plagiarism check.</li>
             <li>Account Privileges: As stated earlier, privileges of access should vary between students' and teachers' accounts on the university's plagiarism checking system. A student's account allows for the submission of documents and access to the final report of the plagiarism review but does not grant permission to review the document for plagiarism which is an exclusive privilege for the teacher account.</li>
             <li>Statistics of Usage: This gives an overall metrics of how users frequently use the university plagiarism checking system, such as total number of submissions, percentage of submitted document reviewed, etc.</li>
           </ol>
