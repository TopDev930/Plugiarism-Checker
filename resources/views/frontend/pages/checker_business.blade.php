              Simply put, a plagiarism checker is software which is primarily used to detect the occurrence of plagiarized content in a material and to also track the original source of such content.<br/>
              In the business sphere, it has also become important to check for plagiarism in submitted contents to guarantee originality. Hence, manuscripts, articles, essays or blog posts submitted for publishing need to be adequately crosschecked to avoid plagiarism and copyright infringement. It is no longer news that your business image can be severely marred by plagiarism should your website be found to publish duplicate contents.  <br/>
              Google defines plagiarism as the publication of duplicate content, and they have strict measures against websites found guilty of plagiarizing. If your website is found to publish too much of someone else's content, Google penalizes your website by dropping your site's URL on search results for your industry keywords. Some popular bloggers and writers have been dropped in Google search ranking because of plagiarism. <br/>
              No company wants to invest its time, money and other valuable resources in attaining high ranking in SEO campaigns and then have it dropped down the rank due to claims of plagiarism. This means that the importance of hiring content creators who are reputable, well aware of writing ethics and familiar with the importance of content originality cannot be overemphasized. <br/>
              While preparing documents and other media posts for public usage, website owners, law firms and other business owners need not to only check for the accuracy of the facts presented in these documents but should also take enough time and employ the use of different plagiarism checking software and web applications available today to track the occurrence of plagiarism in submitted contents in a bid to avoid being sanctioned for publishing plagiarized materials. It may initially seem elusive to always avoid plagiarism, especially for start-up businesses without a member with writing expertise. <br/>Businesses like this find it difficult to develop their own views, and end up paraphrasing any work they love in a bid to assimilate their arguments. Nonetheless, it is crucial for every business to develop their own voice and become an independent original thinker. If a business is not careful, just what would have been a simple plagiarism can turn out to be copyright infringement, and induce litigation. “Whereas attribution can negate the act of plagiarism, it does not mitigate copyright infringement which can occur whether or not the author of a work has been properly identified” (Fishman, 2009).<br/>
              Even though manual checks for plagiarism often take time, automated plagiarism checkers available online are usually faster and can accurately highlight plagiarized contents, so they can be promptly corrected. The time it takes to review a submitted piece for plagiarism will eventually be worth it when the originality of your articles and posts can be verified.<br/>
