          <p>Students of any age face the problem of plagiarism whenever they produce written work of any kind. The internet has made it easy for anyone to copy someone else’s work, but the sheer volume of online content also means that it is easy to use similar phrases throughout your text entirely by accident.
          </p>
          <p>Students are taught from a very young age that copying is against the rules, but repercussions become more severe as they move up through the grades and enter college or university. A college or university paper that is deemed to be plagiarised can mean expulsion and a ruined reputation.</p>
          <p>Of course, anyone with such a tarnish on their record will find it hard to enrol in another institution. The accusation could also result in a lack of future employment and career opportunities.</p>
          <p>Protect Yourself by Using Plagiarism Checkers for Students</p>
          <p>If you are a student, you must protect yourself <a href = "{{ $pages[array_keys($pages)[2]] }}">{{ array_keys($pages)[2] }}</a>  by ensuring that you can prove any work you hand in is entirely your own. Here are a couple of tips on how you can do that.</p>
          <p>Use Citations Properly</p>
          <p>Citations are a way to use another’s work to reinforce a concept or opinion and are an often-necessary addition to a paper. They show the reader that they are not your words and come from somebody else’s work.</p>
          <p>Learning to use citations properly will go a long way to helping protect you against plagiarism. Citations will provide the reader with information on who originally published the words, as well as how and where to find the complete publication.</p>
          <p>Use an Online Plagiarism Checker</p>
          <p>Online plagiarism checkers for students are specialised tools which validate a student’s work against thousands of other published documents contained in scientific databases and millions of other sources.</p>
          <p>Each phrase is checked for uniqueness. Once the check is complete, the student receives a report which details the location of phrases which may need more work. The student can then edit their document and get it ready for handing in or publication – safe in the knowledge that they can prove their work is original.</p>
