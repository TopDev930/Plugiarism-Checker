           One thing that needs to be clarified is that the users must not confuse plagiarism and similarities to be any different. Copying or using the exact words of other writers is both similar and plagiarized. These similarities also include citations and anything that is outside the quotes. We help you identify the ‘real deals’ and remove the fake and valueless words that fall in the premises of plagiarism. We go through all your work and see every comma, sentence and text for any non-original text that can be changed.
