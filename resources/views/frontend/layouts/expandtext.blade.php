                    Plagiarism comes in different ways and forms, and should be avoided by all means because of the serious consequences it poses. There are different types of plagiarism but we will focus on the four major types of plagiarism:<br/>
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                        Direct Plagiarism:  This occurs when you copy a part of someone’s work in its totality and use it for your work without giving the copied work the proper citation. Here the exact same words are used without citing the source of the information. This is the worst kind of plagiarism and should be avoided. This is why it is important to run your work through a plagiarism checker before submitting.</li>
                        <li>
                        Self plagiarism: Self plagiarism is when someone copies their previously  submitted work without the permission of persons involved in that work. It is most frequent in students turning in a work already done by them without the permission of professors involved in that work.</li>
                        <li>
                        Accidental Plagiarism: Here, the plagiarism is not intended but it still carries the same consequences. It happens when someone unintentionally or neglects to quote the source of the information they used  or uses the same kind of words and phrases without proper citation. A good plagiarism checker can be used to identify any plagiarized content in your work for proper citation.</li>
                        <li>
                        Source based plagiarism: This can occur in different ways. It can be as a result of citing a wrong or non existent source  or when all the sources used for a work are not entirely captured in the references given in the work. It can also come in the form of data fabrication.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    Generally plagiarism is completely not allowed and is prohibited, more so as it is not just a civil offense but also considered a criminal offense which can earn you punishments of fine or jail terms.  This is why there is so much emphasis on running your work through a plagiarism scanner to ensure that it is completely safe from any form of plagiarism.<br/>
                    Not withstanding the above, sometimes it difficult to get a 100% free of plagiarism work, which is why some certain percentage of plagiarism is allowed. There are however   no consensus on the amount of plagiarism that can be accepted or overlooked in a manuscript or paper. By popular practices one can say anything below 5% is acceptable,  between 5 to 10 % is not very bad and can be overlooked but if it above 15% then there is a call for concern and that paper should be looked into as it will be deemed to be highly plagiarized. Even in the 15% that is acceptable,  if it is totally from a particular material, then it might be considered as being a plagiarized work . To be on the safe side,  a good plagiarism scanner can be used to reduce traces of plagiarism to the barest minimum.

                        First, it is instructive to state that plagiarism and similarity are both different things and shouldn't be confused with each other.  Plagiarism involves copying some one's work without giving them the credit by quotation or citation, while similarity includes common word, terms and phrases that might be found in a particular work.<br/>
                        Just like plagiarism, there is no consensus on the acceptable rate of similarity to be allowed in a work, however most opinions are that it is more difficult to avoid similarity than it is to avoid plagiarism. It is almost impossible to completely avoid similar words and phrases especially where such words are popular online. Most persons have pegged the acceptable similarity at 20 to 25 % however the lesser the similarity, the better and more accurate your work will be.  To detect similarity in your work, use a plagiarism scanner to check the work before submitting. The plagiarism checker will indicate how many percent of your work is either plagiarized or similar in text to other works, thereby giving you the opportunity to correct . To avoid incidences of similarity, try to paraphrase your work as much as you can to reduce the chances of similarity.

                        Plagiarism is a popular syndrome for persons that interact with a lot of writing examples, including teachers, students, professors and so on. There are different types of plagiarism and a plagiarism scanner can be used to detect most of them. However, we will be looking at 10 most common types of plagiarism:<br/>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Clone plagiarism : This is most popular and perhaps the worst kind of plagiarism. Here, there is a verbatim replication of someone's work with little or no changes, and no proper citation and reference is given to the work copied .
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Error plagiarism (404 error): This occurs where someone quotes an incorrect or non existent source as their references. It is usually impossible to trace such citations because it will lead to non existing sources.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Self plagiarism : This type of plagiarism is also common. It happens when someone copies their former work without giving it proper citation.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Hybrid plagiarism : Here, information is copied from well cited sources but no reference is given to all the information copied. The writer now presents the copied work as a new one.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Find and replace plagiarism : The trick here is to make changes in the  major  keywords and phrases with closely related words, without necessarily changing the whole idea in the context.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Remix plagiarism : This kind of plagiarism occurs where a writer copies ideas from different places and puts them all together in a way that is fit and understandable, then claims the work to be his own idea.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Aggregator plagiarism : Here, the writer includes the correct references and citations of where he got ideas from, but the problem with this is that the work is almost made up of someone else's idea and lacks originality.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Mashup plagiarism : This type of plagiarism occurs when the writer copies information from lots of sources, joins them together in his own document without properly citing or referencing the various sources.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Data falsification : When a writer tampers with the data obtained from another source with the intention of misleading the public, then it is plagiarism. Any such alteration should be duly notified to the appropriate authorities.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                            Inaccurate authorship: Here, a person that contributed to the success of a work does not get credit for work done, or in some instances, a person that did not contribute to the work gets credit for it.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        All these incidences of plagiarism can be reasonably avoided if the work is checked through a plagiarism scanner.
